## Author's Notes

A bonus stage, sporting an 8-Bit interpretation of our "Yuko" canon. It's
textures are to be done in a regular Yuko style, with a local color palette
being used for the 8-Bit aesthetic of players, environment and even the UI.

Stylistic inspirations for the 8-bit look (textures etc.) may include:

- Various historic asian architecture styles
- Sonic The Hedgehog (Game Gear/Master System)
- Wonder Boy (Arcade)
- Bomb Jack (Arcade)
- Mega Man (NES)

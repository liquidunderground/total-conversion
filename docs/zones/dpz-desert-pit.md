# Desert Pit Zone

**Author**: Zibon "PixL" Badi  
**Mapper**: NONE  
**Canon**: Delfid  
**Placement**: Phase 2

## Lore

A desert canyon overrun with giant toys and other nonsense. Given the
deeply-cut rifts, frequent avalanches and the boiling sun, one has to
wonder who would be mad enough to even have come here, let alone build
this giant circus in the middle of nowhere.

## Author's Notes

This map will be accessible in phase 2, but act 2 will have two exits,
depending on whether the player has beaten all the Dr. Asura bosses.
If the bosses are not complete, the first exit will lead back to the
[Crystal Clockworld].  
Afterwards, a cutscene or dialogue event plays that informs the player to
(re)visit this stage and take the now-available second exit, leading to the
boss fight which will initiate phase 3.

The boss fight for this Zone (VS Patsy Toyfeller) will be set on either a
giant circus train or a literal flying circus built on steampunk-esque
machinery. The current soundtrack for the fight to strongly suggest the
former.

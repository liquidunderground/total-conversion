# Lore

(Delfid) Delfid may be gone, but it's knowledge lives on, as inhabitants of
Weissblatt have long been keeping records of it's knwoledge in this
seemingly abandoned castle. Arguably, the only reason the demons didn't
stomp it to dust yet was that most of these recordings were being kept
inside it's vast catacomb system, unknown to most of the planet.

(Yuko) There have long been rumors about the emperors keeping records, but
now that you find yourself right in the middle of it, you notice just how
deep the rabbit hole of the emperor's hidden workings went. Although you
are unlikely to find them, there's no place more suited than this to find
out where the Scrolls of Neumos are located.

## Author's Notes

This one is most useful in context of the Yuko canon, although it's Delfid
version still offers interesting plot elements to pick up elsewhere. As it
stands, it's basically an early draft of [Frozen Record Zone], which the
Delfid canon will most likely use in place of this.

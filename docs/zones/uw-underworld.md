# The Underworld

**Author**: Zibon "PixL" Badi  
**Mapper**: NONE  
**Canon**: Delfid  
**Placement**: Phase 3 (final boss, maybe VS Mara too)

## Lore

After being chased and confronted by our heroes, Mara pulls them into the
underworld where it is uncovered that Mara has been possessed by none other
than the king of demons himself. These winding, non-euclidean caves being
the home domain of the demons, their absurd, alien structure appears
inherently hostile to any non-demonic visitors.

# Nautical Temple Zone

**Author**: Zibon "PixL" Badi

**Canon**: Delfid  
**Placement**: Phase 2

## Lore

The undersea domain of the Bouwder people. Previously isolated from the
outside world, access has been busted open through wide availability of
Delfid teleportation magic. Consequently, it's labyrinthian channels have
quickly dissolved into a war zone between demons and foreigners.

## Author's Notes

"Bouwder" is dutch for builder. Feel free to run with that.

Considering [Frozen Record Zone], there have been ideas to give this zone
hints of a second library instead. Lore-wise this would be justified by
being a second archive, independently developed by the otherwise isolated
Bouwder people. None of this has been fixated yet, though.

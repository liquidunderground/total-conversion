## Lore

The Marble empire has spent most of it's history isolated from the rest of
planet Weissblatt's continents. This is in no small part due to *Stella
Mountain*, the mountain range located at the northern isthmus of the
peninsula. Although nowadays navigable and a well-known tourist spot for
it's beautiful landscapes, it is said that Stella Mountain reaches so far
into the sky that it frequently catches incoming shooting stars.

During the Asura incident, it happened to be the chosen vacation spot of
Kleene Cognara, Elise Cantor and Babel Memto right as they crash landed
alongside Dr. Asura following the destruction of Delfid.

## Author's Notes

This zone has more or less been born out of it's assets. Think of it as a
Green Hill archetype with large vertical scale under a starry sky as
incoming shooting stars form craters on the ground.

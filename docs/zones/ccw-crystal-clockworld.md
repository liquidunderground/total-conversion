The crystalline clockwork of the ether. Normally reserved for Delfid
clergy, a small portion has been busted open during the Asura incident.
Through this space, volunteers and demons alike are now able to travel
across the planet in their hunt for the Chakra Shards.

(Phase 3)  
After beating Patsy Toyfeller at the end of [Desert Pit Zone], the player
will meet Mara here, holding the contract to Patsy's soul and chasing off
into a newly-revealed portal, leading the player into [The Underworld].

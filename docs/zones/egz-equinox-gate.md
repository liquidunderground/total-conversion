## Lore

Hidden inside a volcano, Dr. Asura prepared a launch base for the *Equinox*, 
a rare alignment of Weissblatt's six moons that allows him to utilize the
Chakra Shards' magic for his own purposes.

After the player defeats Patsy Toyfeller during the campaign, MARA steals
the contract to Patsy's soul to lure them into here and use the Chakra
Shards to fuse Weissblatt with the underworld.

## Author's Notes

It's a magic tech launch base inside of a volcano. May contain traces of a
race against MARA, although the difficult parts should be reserved for
[The Underworld]. The second stage of this is intended to be the boss fight
against MARA, with an optional retreat of theirs into the underworld,
should the player have collected all seven Chakra Shards up to this point.

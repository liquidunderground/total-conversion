## Lore

Delfid knew it was not to last, which is why it's citizens sought to
preserve it's wisdom and culture on Weissblatt. This gigantic library
located around the polar caps serves as a record of all but it's most
recent discoveries and now that the orbital city is no more, it remains the
last. Previously guarded to preserve it's accuracy, the opening of the
[Crystal Clockworld] has rendered even the strongest defenses futile against
the flood of incoming demons and volunteers. One has to wonder what drives
everyone to flock to this library, whether they seek to preseve, to share,
to revise or to destroy it's recordings.

## Author's Notes

You can think of FRZ as a hybrid ice/library/military map. A chilling
atmosphere of military defense mixed with vast, almost labyrinthian
libraries

## Lore

What may look like a theme park wrapped around itself is in fact, the main
factory of the largest toy maker on Weissblatt. Perhaps it's because of
this, that Dr. Asura's demons like to take control of toys, as Toyfeller
discovered a way to make their toys develop and run their plants
autonomously. Due to this however, the park slowly evolved into a
disjointed mess of toy logic and it may not just be demons to beware of
here.

## Author's Notes

This is our industrial/lab zone, with some topsy-turvy toy bizarreness
thrown in for playfulness.

For theming reasons, feel free to use some of the weirder mechanics like
bouncing, goop, gravflip, etc. in more puzzling ways here.

For plot reasons, also feel free to make this one of the harder zones and
sequence it towards the end of the nonlinear act

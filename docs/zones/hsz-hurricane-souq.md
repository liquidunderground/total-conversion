## Lore

Soaring the skies of Weissblatt from within the eyes of it's storms, the
flying bazaar has carved out a space truly without bounds. It's both famous
and obscure, ephemeral yet ever-present, changing form, place and structure
as the winds call for it, but persistently congregating the underbelly of
the planet to exchange the most unexpected wares.

## Author's Notes

Think of it as pirate ships in the sky. It's main visual influences would
include Aladdin, Windy Valley, The Egg Carrier and Skies Of Arcadia. 

"Souq" is a lesser-known arabic word for Bazaar, stemming from the akkadian
word for street. Although it may evoke thoughts of carribean piracy and the
ottoman slave market, don't let this restrict you from taking influences
from various worldly and historical cultures and traditions, though. It's a
pervasively international marketplace, afterall.

This stage is inspired by Eric S. Raymond's "The Cathedral and the Bazaar".
It is however, not adapting it's ideas directly.  Instead it follows my own
interpretation of the two archetypes utilized within:

1. *The Cathedral* as a grand unified and - while still crowd-driven -
   centralized development model. Everyone can join and contribute, often
   even on local copies, but everything eventually compiles back into one
   common project with one ultimate codebase.  
   Examples would include the Linux kernel or the Blender CGI modeling toolkit.
2. *The Bazaar* as a fully decentralized development model, with progress
   largely being driven by an evolutionary process of forking, mutation and
   exchange.  
   Examples would include UNIX, the Linux desktop and The Ultimate
   Soundtracker (although mostly driven through piracy).

Whether the cathedral will be used in a dedicated zone or merged into
[Orbital Crystal Zone] is currently undecided.

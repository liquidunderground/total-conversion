**Draft**: 2 "Yuko"  
**Version**: 1.1

## Introductory Cutscene

Decadence, tyranny and chaos: These are the forces that spin the wheel of
civilization.

The Marble empire dates it's history back to Primon, a phoenix with a simple
dream who rose up from nothing to build this land and become it's first
emperor. But even on his deathbed, the secret to his uprising remained a
mystery. Legend has it that under guide of the seven secret scrolls of
Neumos, emperor Primon was given divine powers to become a legendary leader and
shape the lands into what it is today, yet the only one to know the truth
behind these mythical scrolls or whether these even exist was his son,
prince Cleron.

---

One day, the second emperor's decadent and uncompromising rule too came to
a close, as his fortress was stormed by both peasants and his own shogunate
alike to overthrow him and chase him into exile, spinning the wheel along
once more and leaving the legend of the scrolls lost to time.

On the day of the overthrow, shogun Yuko publicly announced to the crowd:
"The emperor's decadence has come to an end!", ceremoniously tying a scroll
to a rocket and shooting it into the sky, never exploding, never to be seen
again.

---

Shogun Yuko and his men tried to solidify themselves as temporary rulers,
but to no avail, as all but his closest generals resigned from the ranks,
forming militias to seize power for themselves.

The following period devolved into a relentless war of all against all,
fracturing the empire into ever smaller city states which all fought for
dominance. In a surprise turn of events, the shogunate was able to
establish dominance without use of it's former armies, as clay soldiers and
other creatures slowly flooded the battlefield in service of establishing
the shogunate's supremacy over the empire.

---

From then on, shogun Yuko and his men unified the empire once again, ruling
it with an iron fist to prevent another such civil war. Amid the populous
in such dire times, the legend of the seven scrolls was shared once again
and it has been foretold that whoever can unearth them will be able break
the vicious cycle once and for all and bring ever-lasting peace to the
lands  ...or ever-lasting destruction.

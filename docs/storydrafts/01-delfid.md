# Liquid Total Conversion - Story

**Draft**: 1 "Delfid"  
**Version**: 2.2.1  
**Written by**: Zibon "PixL" Badi  
**Co-written by**: NotablyPrettyCrazy

## Introductory Cutscene

[IMG: Orbital city built around a giant crystal]

For centuries, the city of Delfid stood as the beacon of diplomacy, technology and progress for planet Weissblatt, floating high above it's kingdoms in the planet's orbit. It's landmark, the *Enlightenment Crystal* powers the entire city and is worshiped by the city's population for fostering it's culture and imbuing it with unmatched spiritual powers.

[IMG: Alex spotting Dr. Asura near the crystal]

*Alex Felitas* - a young Delfid priest - was tasked with tending the crystal's magic one day right when they noticed someone with a mysterious book next to it:

*Alex*: Hey, who are you?! Get away from the sacred crystal!

*Dr. Asura*: "There you are... Hang in there, I'm coming..." He looked over at Alex in response. "My name is Dr. Asura and I'm afraid I need to use that crystal."

[IMG: Enlightenment crystal starting to corrupt]

The Enlightenment Crystal started to cloud as it absorbed the dark magic it was exposed to and became contaminated. Alex quickly rushed towards Dr. Asura to take him away from the crystal and stop the corruption.

*Dr. Asura*: "I'm sorry, but there's no other way..." Dr. Asura pushed Alex away and stuck a black rose to the Enlightenment Crystal.

[IMG: Overgrown Delfid exploding]

In a last ditch effort trying to save the crystal, Alex tried to destroy the rose using their magic, but it was already too late. The rose had already spread throughout the crystal and destabilized it's powers. Upon being hit with magic, the crystal exploded into seven *Chakra Shards*, which flew towards the planet and spread across it's kingdoms.

[IMG: Alex falling towards earth, surrounded by debris]

Floating through the planet's orbit after the explosion, Alex saw nothing but debris of what once was Delfid. Removed from the crystal's power and unsure of their fate, Alex used their last remaining magic to cast a distress signal across the planet, reaching countless heroes:

Meanwhile on the surface of Weissblatt, Kleene, Elise and Babel were taking a hike in the mountains, when suddenly something crash landed near them, forcing them to take cover close by. From the ashes and smoke of the crater, a few figures emerge:

*Dr. Asura*: "Demons, find the Chakra Shards and bring them to the launch base! We don't have much time before the equinox!"

*Alex (distress signal)*: "Delfid and the Enlightenment Crystal have been destroyed by a  man named Dr. Asura, who's seeking to abuse it's power! Whomever hears this, please find it's pieces before he does and stop him! I'm not sure if I'll survive but if I do, I will do everything in my power to help you! The fate of Weissblatt depends on you!"

[IMG: Dr. Asura glaring suspiciously]

Dr. Asura: "..."

Dr. Asura: "...and make sure no one will cause any problems..."

## Lore and ingame story beats (SPOILERS)

Before the Delfid incident, Patsy was tricked by demons into losing his mind and Dr. Asura desperately signed a contract with the *king of demons* to became squad leader for the demons stationed on Weissblatt. His contract held the conditions that he seized the power of the enlightenment crystal to locate Patsy's lost soul and cast demonic power across Weissblatt.

After the intro, Alex crash lands on Weissblatt and proceeds to regain their powers to help locate the Chakra Shards. They eventually meet the main characters in a secret stage after which they are unlocked [like Amy].

Most enemies will be demon-posessed toys built by Patsy which are exorcised upon destruction, releasing purified souls back into the cycle of rebirth [like Flickies].

After the battle against Patsy on his giant desert toy train [ACZ Fang battle], *Mara* takes things into their own hands and steals the contract to Dr. Asura's and Patsy's souls.

After *Mara* is defeated near the end of the game [BCZ Metal Sonic battle], it is revealed that the toy has been possessed by none other than *the king of demons* which pulls the heroes into the underworld for final boss fight against their true form.

## Characters

**Kleene Cognara** [Tails replacement; main character to have easy mode be the default]
: A gifted engineer who uses a variety of self-built knacks and gizmos to get around. Frequently uses his jet-boosted clothing to fly for short periods of time.

[*Appearance*: Scrappy, maybe steampunk]

**Elise Cantor** [Sonic replacement]
: A high-class musician and dancer. Her impeccable sense of rhytm and bodily control combined with her athletic skills allow her to proficiently navigate any terrain and perform maneuvers others may consider impossible, such as the air dash.
(I like this description as it basically telegraphs her as a high skill ceiling character)

[*Appearance*: Very classical. A mixture between a ballet dancer and a knightess]

**Babel Memto** [Knuckles replacement]
: A mole librarian with a knack for soft science and history. Thrives in discovering hidden details and digging through mountains of books. Seeks to reconstruct Delfid's lost knowledge by reassembling the enlightenment crystal and rebuild it's society.

**Alex Felitas**
: A priest of the Delfid enlightenment. After their encounter with Dr. Asura, they crash landed on Weissblatt and are seeking to regain their magical powers to save the Chakra Shards from Dr. Asura and his demons.

[*Appearance*: Non-binary magical girl of feline species]

[*Moves*: Staff whack]

---

**Dr. Roy Asura**
: Formerly Dr. Fishbart Toyfeller, he took on a secret identity as temporary squad leader of all demons on Weissblatt. Having signed a contract to the king of demons out of desperation, he's working to seize control of the Enlightenment Crystal to save the lost soul of his mad brother Patsy.

[*Appearance*: Glasses&Mustache goldfish in a detachable flying fish bowl propped on top of a tuxedo]

**Patsy Toyfeller** [Fang replacement]
: Asura's partner in crime. Originally an unsuccessful toymaker, Patsy started exhibiting more deranged and clown-inspired behavior as time went on, increasingly drowning Weissblatt in toys possessed by Dr. Asura's demons. Few have ever survived a direct encounter with him in this state and fewer have ever seen him without his unicycle.

[Moves: Unicycle bouncing and an extendable boxing glove]

**Mara** [Metal Sonic replacement]
: A possessed wind-up toy which went rogue and stole the contract to Patsy's soul after he's been defeated. Can modulate the speed of it's key to accellerate and fly through the air at certain speeds.

[*Appearance*: Antrhopomorphic elephant with the face of the buddhist demon Mara]

[*Moves*: **Elephant drive** which allows Mara to gain speed and glide through the air]

**The king of demons** [Brak replacement]
: What it says on the tin. Plotted to rid Patsy of his mind to trick Dr. Asura into signing a contract to him and attack the Enlightenment Crystal. Disguised himself as *Mara* during the operation to collect the Chakra shards for himself and secure demonic influence over Weissblatt. After his plot has been uncovered by the heroes, he faces them off in the underworld to save his plan to throw Weissblatt into a new dark age.

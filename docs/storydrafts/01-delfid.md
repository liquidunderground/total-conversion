## Introductory Cutscene

[IMG: Orbital city built around a giant crystal]

For centuries, the city of Delfid stood as the beacon of diplomacy, technology and progress for planet Weissblatt, floating high above it's kingdoms in the planet's orbit. It's landmark, the *Enlightenment Crystal* powers the entire city and is worshiped by the city's population for fostering it's culture and imbuing it with unmatched spiritual powers.

[IMG: Alex spotting Dr. Asura near the crystal]

*Alex Felitas* - a young Delfid priest - was tasked with tending the crystal's magic one day right when they noticed someone with a mysterious book next to it:

*Alex*: Hey, who are you?! Get away from the sacred crystal!

*Dr. Asura*: "There you are... Hang in there, I'm coming..." He looked over at Alex in response. "My name is Dr. Asura and I'm afraid I need to use that crystal."

[IMG: Enlightenment crystal starting to corrupt]

The Enlightenment Crystal started to cloud as it absorbed the dark magic it was exposed to and became contaminated. Alex quickly rushed towards Dr. Asura to take him away from the crystal and stop the corruption.

*Dr. Asura*: "I'm sorry, but there's no other way..." Dr. Asura pushed Alex away and stuck a black rose to the Enlightenment Crystal.

[IMG: Overgrown Delfid exploding]

In a last ditch effort trying to save the crystal, Alex tried to destroy the rose using their magic, but it was already too late. The rose had already spread throughout the crystal and destabilized it's powers. Upon being hit with magic, the crystal exploded into seven *Chakra Shards*, which flew towards the planet and spread across it's kingdoms.

[IMG: Alex falling towards earth, surrounded by debris]

Floating through the planet's orbit after the explosion, Alex saw nothing but debris of what once was Delfid. Removed from the crystal's power and unsure of their fate, Alex used their last remaining magic to cast a distress signal across the planet, reaching countless heroes:

Kleene: "Thanks for letting me test my new perso-copter under heavy load."

Babel: "Oh I'm very pleased by this trip myself, Kleene! I've long been looking for an opportunity to explore the mountains."

Elise: "Sure Kleene. You know I'd never-"

\*BOOM!\*

Elise: "WHAT THE- ... Did you hear that?"

[IMG: Our heroes looking up at Delfid exploding in the sky]

Kleene, Elise and Babel looked up at the sky, witnessing Delfid exploding.

Babel: "This can't be ..."

Before they could even recover from the shock of the sight, something came wheezing past them and crashed Kleene's perso-copter.

[IMG: Our heroes crash landed among smoke and debris, Dr. Asura and his demons nearby]

*Dr. Asura*: "Demons, find the Chakra Shards and bring them to the launch base! We don't have much time before the equinox!"

Babel: "Chakra Shards? OH SWEET DELFID! This can only mean-"

[IMG: Dr. Asura glaring suspiciously at our heroes]

Dr. Asura: "..."

Dr. Asura: "...and take care of anyone that could ruin our plans..."

[IMG: Our heroes surrounded by demons with a portal opening behind them]

As Kleene, Elise and Babel were being surrounded by Dr. Asura's demons, a magic portal opened behind them, emitting a voice ...

*Alex (through portal)*: "Inhabitants of Weissblatt! Delfid and the Enlightenment Crystal have been destroyed by a man named Dr. Asura and he's seeking to abuse the power of the Chakra Shards! Whomever hears this, please find them before he does and stop him! I'm not sure if I'll survive this but I've opened these portals across the planet to help you find them! The fate of Weissblatt depends on you!"

Kleene: "RUN!!"

Knowing no other way to escape Dr. Asura and his demons, the trio fled into the newly opened portal.



## Lore and ingame story beats (SPOILERS)

Before the Delfid incident, Patsy was tricked by demons into losing his mind and Dr. Asura desperately signed a contract with the *king of demons* to became squad leader for the demons stationed on Weissblatt. His contract held the conditions that he seized the power of the enlightenment crystal to locate Patsy's lost soul and cast demonic power across Weissblatt.

After the intro, Alex crash lands on Weissblatt and proceeds to regain their powers to help locate the Chakra Shards. They eventually meet the main characters in a [secret stage][Hurricane Souq Zone] after which they are unlocked.

Most enemies will be demon-posessed toys built by Patsy which are exorcised upon destruction, releasing purified souls back into the cycle of rebirth [like Flickies].

The game starts out in the [Crystal Clockworld] with all phase 1 maps accessible to access. Once the player has finished all boss fights against Dr. Asura, the boss fight against Patsy at the end of [Desert Pit] is unlocked, initiating phase 2.

After the battle against Patsy on his giant desert toy train, *MARA* takes things into their own hands and steals the contract to Dr. Asura's and Patsy's souls. MARA uses the opportunity as a trap to lure the player into Dr. Asura's launch base to prepare for the Equinox. To stop MARA from using the player's Chakra Shards to fuse Weissblatt with the Underworld, the player faces them off in a boss fight. After beating MARA, Patsy is unlocked and if the player hasn't collected all seven Chakra Shards until this point, the game ends here.

If the player managed to collect all seven Chakra Shards throughout the game, MARA then retreats into [The Underworld] during a much harder second race after which the player encounters the true final boss fight against MARA's true form: *Kotu - the king of the underworld*.

## Characters

**Kleene Cognara** [Tails replacement; main character to have easy mode be the default]
: A gifted engineer who uses a variety of self-built knacks and gizmos to get around. Frequently uses his jet-boosted clothing to fly for short periods of time.

[*Appearance*: Scrappy, maybe steampunk]

**Elise Cantor** [Sonic replacement]
: A high-class musician and dancer. Her impeccable sense of rhytm and bodily control combined with her athletic skills allow her to proficiently navigate any terrain and perform maneuvers others may consider impossible, such as the air dash.
(I like this description as it basically telegraphs her as a high skill ceiling character)

[*Appearance*: Very classical. A mixture between a ballet dancer and a knightess]

**Babel Memto** [Knuckles replacement]
: A mole librarian with a knack for soft science and history. Thrives in discovering hidden details and digging through mountains of books. Seeks to reconstruct Delfid's lost knowledge by reassembling the enlightenment crystal and rebuild it's society.

**Alex Felitas**
: A priest of the Delfid enlightenment. After their encounter with Dr. Asura, they crash landed on Weissblatt and are seeking to regain their magical powers to save the Chakra Shards from Dr. Asura and his demons.

[*Appearance*: Non-binary magical girl of feline species]

[*Moves*: Staff whack]

---

**Dr. Roy Asura** [phase 1 boss]
: Formerly Dr. Fishbart Toyfeller, he took on a secret identity as temporary squad leader of all demons on Weissblatt. Having signed a contract to the king of the underworld out of desperation, he's working to seize control of the Enlightenment Crystal to save the lost soul of his mad brother Patsy.

[*Appearance*: Glasses&Mustache goldfish in a detachable flying fish bowl propped on top of a tuxedo]

**Patsy Toyfeller** [phase 2 boss]
: Asura's partner in crime. Originally an unsuccessful toymaker, Patsy started exhibiting more deranged and clown-inspired behavior as time went on, increasingly drowning Weissblatt in toys possessed by Dr. Asura's demons. Few have ever survived a direct encounter with him in this state and fewer have ever seen him without his unicycle.

[Moves: Unicycle bouncing and an extendable boxing glove]

**MARA** ["fake" final boss]
: A possessed wind-up toy which went rogue and stole the contract to Patsy's soul after he's been defeated. Can modulate the speed of it's key to accellerate and fly through the air at certain speeds.

[*Appearance*: Antrhopomorphic elephant with the face of the buddhist demon Mara]

[*Moves*: **Elephant drive** which allows MARA to gain speed and glide through the air]

**The king of the underworld (KOTU)** ["true" final boss]
: What it says on the tin. Plotted to rid Patsy of his mind to trick Dr. Asura into signing a contract to him and attack the Enlightenment Crystal. Disguised himself as *MARA* during the operation to collect the Chakra shards for himself and secure demonic influence over Weissblatt. After his plot has been uncovered by the heroes, he faces them off in the underworld to save his plan to throw Weissblatt into a new dark age.
